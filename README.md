Hello, I'm Mekuanint, This is also my first Node.js mini Project called Meku Farm Store which i made using node js back when i was studying Node.js few months a go. It was an exercise that i've being working on just for learning purpose only, it's not a real life one. 

1 #To run this Code you should install Node.js on your platform (--Must--)
2 #Then inside Visual Studio code install nodemon from npm package using i nodemon (--Optional--)
3 #Then after installation of nodemon is done just type "npm start" on the terminal,
4 #Incase if you didn't install nodemon, type "node index.js" into the terminal,
5 #then you are done u can look at the complete page now.

Thank you..!!
